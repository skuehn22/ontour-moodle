# Sticky Notes #

Sticky Notes is an activity for creating a sticky notes wall for brainstormings, ranking...

# Features ##

On install, admin can choose 6 colors which will be used throughall activities in Moodle. Default colors
have been chosen to respect accessibility and colorblindness.

Adding a Sticky Notes activity is like adding any other activity in Moodle. Turn on editing mode and
add activity "Sticky Notes".

When using the activity, users can create, update and delete their own notes in different columns
(columns can only be created by teachers).

When creating or editing a note, users can place it where he wants : they can choose column,
and/or they can put it before or after another note.
To change order for a note and/or put it in another column, you can use update interface, 
but you can also move notes using drag and drop. Click on a note and move it with your mouse
to its new place. Drag and drop also works on smartphones or tablets.

It gives possibility to "like" notes just by cliking a little heart icon.

When creating an activity, teacher can define several features or limitation :
- capability to create a note with different background color
- choose colors to use in activity between the 6 default colors
- add a meaning for every color
- limit the number of notes a user can create 
- limit the number of votes a user can do
- enable the rotate effect.

This activity is anonymous for student : no names appears. But teachers can choose to view creator names
for their own use.
