## Notetaker module

A simple notetaker activity plugin for Moodle that allows a student to create notes within a course.

If the notetaker instance is set to allow public notes, the student can choose whether their notes should be private and only visible to themselves, or to make them public and share them with other course participants.

Teachers can manage all notes including those set to private.

Each note can be tagged. Notes can be searched by name.
